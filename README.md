# Enrollment Report Project

Contributors: Matthew White


## Description:

This project was created as a way to automate a more time intensive work task. Create an easy flow for analyzing assistance program data to find number of individuals actively enrolled, individuals whos' eligibility ended in the previous month, two months ago, and three months ago grouped by sub-program.

Solves an issue of using excel pivot tables and manual manipulation to get this information. Ultimately saves time in a monthly report.


## To run:

$ python3 EnrollmentReport.py

Enter the .csv file to use (i.e. test.csv)

Enter the date range for the previous month, two months ago, and three months ago.


## To do:

Create a formated(easy to read by a wide audience) file output that can be printed and distributed.

Input validation.

Add a GUI.


## Problems:

Throws an error if an invalid entry is made in any of the input().
